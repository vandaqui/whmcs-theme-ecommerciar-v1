Current Version: 1.0
## Compatibility

This repo theme is compatible with WHMCS 8.4.1 and later.

## Usage

All changes made here were done to suit my needs only. It might not be ideal for you. But feel free to modify what looks ideal for you.

###### My Needs Are:
- The customer enters the client area to buy a plan and inform the desired domain afterwards.
- The template is not suitable for someone who is looking foward to selling domains (up to V1.0).
- The template is not suitable for someone who is looking foward to selling hosting services (to V1.0).
- The customer can open tickets via the client area.
- This template has reduced visual information, one of the main goals is to be straight as possible.
- The knowlegdebase will redirect to a video tutorial platform.
